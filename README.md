# seqenv version 1.0.3
Assign environment ontology (EnvO) terms to short DNA sequences. More information at: http://environments.hcmr.gr/seqenv.html

### Installing
To install `seqenv` onto your machine, use the python package manager:

    $ pip install seqenv

You might be installing this onto a computer server which you don't own and thus don't have sufficient privileges. In that case you can install everything in your home directory like this:

    $ pip install --user seqenv

If this still doesn't work, you might be missing the `pip` program on your system or the correct version of Python (any version `2.7.x`). You can get both of these things by using using this little project: https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv

### Dependencies
* You need to have a copy of the NCBI nucleotide data base (called `nt`) installed locally as well as the `blastn` executable in your `$PATH`. So that BLAST finds the NT database, you can edit your `.ncbirc` file.
* The project also depends on some other python modules such as `biopython`. Happily, these will be installed automatically when calling the `pip` command above.

### Optional dependencies
* To compile parts of the software you might need a copy of the BOOST libraries as well as the SWIG libraries.

### Usage
Once that is done, you can start processing FASTA files from the command line. For using the default parameters you can just type:

    $ seqenv sequences.fasta

We will then assume that you have inputed 16S sequences. To modify the database or input a different type of sequences:

    $ seqenv sequences.fasta --seqtype prot --db nr

To modify the minimum identity in the similarity search, use the following:

    $ seqenv sequences.fasta --min_identity 0.97

If you have abundance data you would like to add to your analysis you can specify it like this in a TSV file:

    $ seqenv sequences.fasta --abundances counts.tsv

### All parameters
Several other options are possible. Here is a list describing them all:

   * `--seq_type`: Sequence type `nucl` or `prot`, for nucleotides or amino acids respectively (Default: `nucl`).
   * `--search_algo`: Search algorithm. Either `blast` or `vsearch` (Default: `blast`).
   * `--search_db`: The database to search against (Default: `nt`). You can specify the full path or make a `~/.ncbirc` file.
   * `--backtracking`: For every term identified by the tagger, we will propagate frequency counts up the acyclic directed graph described by the ontology. Defaults to `False`.
   * `--normalization`: Should we divide the counts of every input sequence by the number of text entries that were associated to it. Defaults to `True`.
   * `--num_threads`: Number of cores to use (Defaults to the total number of cores). Use `1` for non-parallel processing.
   * `--out_dir`: The output directory in which to store the result and intermediary files. Defaults to the same directory as the input file.
   * `--min_identity`: Minimum identity in similarity search (Default: `0.97`). Note: not available when using `blastp`.
   * `--e_value`: Minimum e-value in similarity search (Default: 0.0001`).
   * `--max_targets`: Maximum number of reference matches in the similarity search (Default: `10`).
   * `--min_coverage`: Minimum query coverage in similarity search (Default: `0.97`).
   * `--abundances`: Abundances file as TSV with OTUs as rows and sample names as columns (Default: None).
   * `--N`: If abundances are given, pick only the top N sequences (Default: `1000`).

### Introduction
The continuous drop in the associated costs combined with the increased efficiency of the latest high-throughput sequencing technologies has resulted in an unprecedented growth in sequencing projects. Ongoing endeavours such as the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org) and the [Ocean Sampling Day](http://www.microb3.eu/osd) are transcending national boundaries and are attempting to characterise the global microbial taxonomic and functional diversity for the benefit of mankind. The collection of sequencing information generated by such efforts is vital to shed light on the ecological features and the processes characterising different ecosystems, yet, the full knowledge discovery potential can only be unleashed if the associated meta data is also exploited to extract hidden patterns. For example, with the majority of genomes submitted to NCBI, there is an associated PubMed publication and in some cases there is a GenBank field called "isolation sources" that contains rich environmental information.
With the advances in community-generated standards and the adherence to recommended annotation guidelines such as those of [MIxS](http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/MIxS) of the Genomics Standards Consortium, it is now feasible to support intelligent queries and automated inference on such text resources.

The [Environmental Ontology](http://environmentontology.org/) will be a critical part of this approach as it gives the ontology for the concise, controlled description of environments. It thus provides structured and controlled vocabulary for the unified meta data annotation, and also serves as a source for naming environmental information. Thus, we have developed the `seqenv` pipeline capable of annotating sequences with environment descriptive terms occurring within their records and/or in relevant literature. Given a set of sequences, `seqenv` retrieves highly similar sequences from public repositories (NCBI GenBank). Subsequently, from each of these records, text fields carrying environmental context information (such as the reference title and the **isolation source**) are extracted. Once the relevant pieces of text for each matching sequence have been gathered, they are then processed by a text mining module capable of identifying EnvO terms mentioned in them terms such as glacier, pelagic, forest, lagoon). The identified EnvO terms along with their frequencies of occurrence are then subjected to clustering analysis and multivariate statistics. As a result, tagclouds and heatmaps of environment descriptive terms characterizing different sequences/samples are generated. The `seqenv` pipeline can be applied to any set of nucleotide and protein sequences. Annotation of metagenomic samples, in particular 16S rRNA sequences is also supported.

The pipeline has already been applied to a range of datasets (e.g Greek lagoon, Swedish lake/river, African and Asian pitlatrine datasets, Black Sea sediment sample datasets have been processed).

### Pipeline overview
#### This is an old version of the diagram.. the current version of seqenv doesn't exactly do this.

### Tutorial
We will first run `seqenv` on a 16S rRNA dataset using ***isolation sources*** as a text source. Here, `abundance.tsv` is a species abundance file (97% OTUs) processed through [`illumitag`](https://github.com/limno/illumitag) software and `centers.fasta` contains the corresponding sequences for the OTUs.

~~~
$ ls
abundance.tsv
centers.fasta

$ seqenv centers.fasta --abundances abundance.tsv --seq_type nucl --out_dir output --N 1000 --min_identity 0.99
~~~

The output you will receive should look something like this:

~~~

Once the pipeline has finished processing, you will have the following contents in the output folder:

~~~
$ ls output/
gi_to_counts.pickle      samples.biom          seq_to_names.tsv
gi_to_matches.pickle     samples_to_names.tsv  top_seqs.blastout
list_concepts_found.tsv  seq_to_concepts.tsv   top_seqs.fasta
renamed.fasta            seq_to_gis.pickle     top_seqs.fasta.parts
~~~

The most interesting files are probably:

* `list_concepts_found.tsv` links every OTU to all its relevent BLAST hits and linked ENVO terms.
* `seq_to_names.tsv` a matrix linking every OTU to its "composition" in terms of ENVO identifiers translated to readable names.
* `samples_to_names.tsv` if an abundance file was provided, this is a a matrix linking every one of your samples to its "composition" in terms of ENVO identifiers translated to readable names.
