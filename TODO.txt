Uniquify the isolation sources with dates ?

Extract information only for a subset of envo terms (such as biome feature) (i.e. the masking feature)

Have the setup.py compile the tagger (swig is a new dependency in that case) (problematic other libraries)

Or replace the tagger with an online service, but this can be detrimental to the pipeline to rely on custom services.

Once this is done test that seqenv can easily be installed on a different university cluster easily through one pip command

Integrate VSEARCH in the sequence similarity search as an alternative to BLAST

Have the outputted named with OTU names sorted in the same order as the user provided them

For the publication, transfer the repository to github and make it public

Check Christina's bug about non float matrix multiplication

Add the word cloud and heatmap generation back.
